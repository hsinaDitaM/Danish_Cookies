What i got wrong in this problem was that i accidentally mis-clicked the option two. i did not review the answers and when u submitted it, i was socked that it was wrong. Option A and D sounded very similar to me. so much that i could not pick between the two. i decided to flip and coin and if it landed on head i would pick A and if it landed on tails, i would pick D. eventually it landed on heads and picked A and it was somehow wrong. .",

Fifteen minutes later I was at home and in front of my computer, fixing an error in our backend code that our backend developer, Vyaan Guatem, could not figure. After 20 minutes of banging my head against the table, I spotted the error, a missing semicolon. . 5:00 . I was eating dinner when the scrum master, Nikhil Chakavartula, called me. Nikhil Chakavartula said that we f-ed up. We were supposed to put our project on another separate fastpages but rather, we put it on out website. When I heard Nikhil Chakavartula say that, my shoulders were filled with 20 pound blinks of tungsten, the heaviest metal known to men. I put my put my thumb between the screen and the keyboard of my laptop and flung it open. I quickly navigated to the fastpage github page and cloned the repository. There was one minor problem, I had forgotten how to make a fastpage because it had been 12 weeks since the other one I made. I quickly and carefully followed the directions but as soon as i looked up to the clock up on my wall, it was 6:30. . 6:30 . I paddled the fast as i could so i would not be late. i was using all of the power left on my legs to bike uphill. as i reached the front of the school, i saw out frontend developer, Qais Jamili. Qais Jamili was waiting for the rest of us. I explained to Qais Jamili what Nikhil Chakavartula had said to me earlier. Qais Jamili banged and smashed his head on the concreate floor out of desperation until i stopped Qais Jamili. as soon as i stopped him, Nikhil Chakavartula and Vyaan Guatem showed up. We went in our designated room and set up our project. we were the black ducklings amongst the yellow ones. . . 7:00 . Our Teacher, Mr Yueng, came up with a clipboard and wanted to check and grade our assignment. I pressed play on the code and the Hangman appeared on the screen. Nikhil Chakavartula entered letters and said words that explained the code to Mr Yeung. Mr Yueng nodded his head in approval and said “good job.” We asked him if we could leave and he said we could leave after we check out some of the other classes artwork. I agreed and went around with Qais Jamili to check out other artwork from other classes. i saw one artwork from ceramics class that caught my eye. i was supposed to take a picture of an artwork and critique it for another class. i turned to Qais Jamili and demanded him to take a picture with his phone and sent to me as i forgot my phone in the rush i was in. Qais Jamili agreed and took a picture. Qais Jamili and I walked to the front door and shaked goodbye. “I would see Qais Jamili in 12 hours” I said as I held back my tears. out of frustration, I punched Qais Jamili in the face and hopped on my bike and went home. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;bash&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 18 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;bash&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[0] Python &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;John Doe&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 18, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;bash&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Mati&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Danish&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;May 30&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;matiullahd32748@stu.powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;non&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Elon&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Musk&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;1969 prob&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;beverly hills?&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;elonmusk@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;Tesla&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Mati&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Danish&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;May 30&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;matiullahd32748@stu.powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;non&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Elon&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Musk&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;1969 prob&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;beverly hills?&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;elonmusk@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;Tesla&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Mati Danish Residence: San Diego Birth Day: May 30 Cars: non Elon Musk Residence: beverly hills? Birth Day: 1969 prob Cars: Tesla . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Mati Danish Residence: San Diego Birth Day: May 30 Cars: non Elon Musk Residence: beverly hills? Birth Day: 1969 prob Cars: Tesla . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Mati Danish Residence: San Diego Birth Day: May 30 Cars: non Elon Musk Residence: beverly hills? Birth Day: 1969 prob Cars: Tesla . Hacks .
