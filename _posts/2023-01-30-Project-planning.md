Chat GPT was sponsored by Microsoft and now has 10 billion dollars since they think its the google killer. The GPT saves from the secondary clicking, don’t know the source (cite sources). Good because you can answer right away. 

- Computer bias - worry ab using the computers, inserting own bias into the computers

### Features and design:
Club info database
Anyone viewing the website can see the database
However, only people with “admin” can interact with the page 
Database with each club: There are reviews for each club so students wanting to join different clubs can see different input on different clubs.
Each club can have many reviews
The upload files feature allows club leadership to submit necessary files to a database that allows ASB administrators to view and confirm files.
Club search feature: search a topic of interest and you will get a club with that interest
