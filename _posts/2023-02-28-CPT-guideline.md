# Features:

Taiyo - product cards and filters and different brands

Luna - Email subscription, Formatting of the website

Ethan - Heart function

Mati -  Dealership function
 

# Program Purpose and Function
Program Purpose:
The purpose of this function is to allow the user to identify the nearest dealership to them and if they want to, the can add their local dealership to improve the dealership. 
# Function:
The function of the Dealership and the Dealership post is to allow the user to... the fetch the nearest Dealership and they can post their local dealership. 

# Data Abstraction
Two code segments:
The backend will store the name of the dealership, the address of the dealership, the longitude, and the latitude. 

Identifies the name of the variable:
i will name the variable "the Name, Deealership address, longitude, latitude" in the database. 

Describes the data in the list:
The list would allow the user to acctuartly locate a dealership using their longitude and latitude but ouput the dealership name and adsress. 

# Managing Complexity
by managing complexity, i can work on different features at different times, this way the workload isn't too much and can managing the complexity. 

# Procedural Abstraction
A feature that i am thinking of adding on the Dealership and the Dealership feature later is that the users can manually access the databse and delete the dealerships there. 

# Functionality:
This is better than looking at google maps because it shows accurately how far away is a dealerships without having to eyeball it. 
# Algorithm Implementation
The algorithim would store what the user's location and display the nearest. 

# Testing
i can add fake dealerships to the database if the locating feature works and just doesn't output the same dealership for all of the users.
