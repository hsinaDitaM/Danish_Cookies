# test correction:
question 11:

This option is incorrect. The code segment simulates a spinner in which selecting each of three sections is equally likely.

question 21:
![image](/Danish_Cookies/images/q21-2.png)
This option is incorrect. This code segment moves the robot forward three squares, rotates it right one time so that the robot faces the bottom of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares.

question 29:
![image](/Danish_Cookies/images/q29.png)
This option is incorrect. With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output
of true. The second OR gate will have one false input and one true input, causing the circuit to have an output of true.

question 30:
![image](/Danish_Cookies/images/q30.png)
This option is incorrect. This approximation assumes that the  Analysis procedure is called only twice.


question 31:
![image](/Danish_Cookies/images/q31.png)
This option is incorrect. Both programs correctly move the robot to the gray square.


# reflection:
i am feeling confident about the ap exam, but i could be panicking during the exam and miss some stupid points that i would have scored if i hadn't
