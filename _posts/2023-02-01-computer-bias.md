### crossover group
- Overall, 18 percent of users belonged to the 18 to 24-year age group. tiktok is forages 13 to 17 and there is no purposeful inclusions that people make about age groups.
- its not purposeful inclusions because people are just trying to use the apps and don't care about the voice. it is good bushiness because, from my experience the female voice is musch more clearer. humans have a prefernce to hear femake voices more that male voices.
- my youtube recommendation. it choses what i watch for the next 20 to 40 minute of my day.

# CROWDSOURSINCE

We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through APIâ€™s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.
- the api's that i hace used the the google translate api and the worldwide clocks for indivuaidial time zone. 

We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
- the biggest discorvery tha ti have made in jithub is that you can directly lunch vscode inside your browser and edited the repo there. 

Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?
- no i did not see anything interesting in the code.
