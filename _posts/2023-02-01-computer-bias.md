### crossover group
- Overall, 18 percent of users belonged to the 18 to 24-year age group. tiktok is forages 13 to 17 and there is no purposeful inclusions that people make about age groups.
- its not purposeful inclusions because people are just trying to use the apps and don't care about the voice. it is good bushiness because, from my experience the female voice is musch more clearer. humans have a prefernce to hear femake voices more that male voices.
- my youtube recommendation. it choses what i watch for the next 20 to 40 minute of my day.

## Hewlett-Packket Computer
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?

 - the owner of the this computer does not think this computer was being intentional. 

If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

- it was testing error because Hewlett-Packett did not test their new product on dark skinned people. 

How do you think this happened?

- Hewlett-Packett did not test their technology with darker skinned people, therefore they did not have time to tweak the camera. 

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

- it is harmer to exclude people

Should it be corrected?

- yes, it should.

What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

- test the new Hewlett-Packett cameras on darker skinned people. 

# CROWDSOURSINCE

We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through APIâ€™s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.
- the api's that i hace used the the google translate api and the worldwide clocks for indivuaidial time zone. 

We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
- the biggest discorvery tha ti have made in jithub is that you can directly lunch vscode inside your browser and edited the repo there. 

Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?
- no i did not see anything interesting in the code. 


# Hacks for 5.4
CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- a crowdsource idea that i have is to ask all of the compsci students to write  lines of a code for a program. This will make sure that sure that students can contribute equally and show off thier coding skills.
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
- well, not everyone in Del Norte knows how to code so what we can do is to rank all of the classes in del norte without any bias that might affect the outcome the result of the crowdsoucing. 
What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
- a type of data to capture is the students class that they are attending it for. this could impress some teachers and make others sad or disappointed in their students. 

# Hacks for 5.3
My thoughts on HP's testing fail is that gathering people to experiment their device can be hard. they need to pay for each of the testers for their time. they also have to avoid too much test people as not 'leak' their new technology to the world and spoil the awe in its release. There are also backlashes that you can recive if you dont do much testing and releasing the new technology to the public, which HP faced with their face tracking webcame.
