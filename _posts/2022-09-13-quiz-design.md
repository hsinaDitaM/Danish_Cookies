### Design
I went for a simple preset theme in the code.org website. it is called Area 51. The start button is outlined purple and has green text. there will be an image of the supes on top of the start button and a title on top of the image. when start button is clicked, it would go into the first question. it would show a image of Homelander with the caption of "what is the name of this character. the four options are "homesaver, homelander, clonol America, and captain colony." when the wrong ansewr is clicked, it will switch to screen there it says wrong answer. but when the right answer is clicked, it will move on the second question. if you get all three question correct, then you will be taken to the winners page.

### Success 
- added question 1-3
- added images
- changed the theme
- added a winners page
- coded in a the wrong answer page
