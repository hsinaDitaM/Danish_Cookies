# Three beneficial effect:

1. Students who are getting their drivers licesne can see what car fits them the most
2. the students with not as much dough, can see which car is bang for the buck
3. students rolling dough can see which car can get them the most out of their money.

# A potential Harm:

a potential harm that out project can have on the students is that they can get jealous of other students cars and may cause in students fighting to get the best car.

# Personal experience  on internet blockers:

near the start of the school year, we used a tool called aws. we could not use aws because it was blocked by school. we could bypass this with a VPN but not everyone had access to VPN. The con to a vpn is that it makes the internet connection really slow and i could not do anything and had to do the project by myself at home, which sucked. 

# A Downside

A downside to the digital divide is that students will be more prone to cyberbullying, sexting, or  other student privacies. This can be avoided by adding admin passwords that differ each day and if a students want to access a website, they would have to get the code from their teacher.
